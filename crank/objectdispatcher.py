This is the main dispatcher module.

Dispatch works as follows:
Start at the Originating dispatcher, which must
have a _dispatch function, which defines how we move
from dispatch object to dispatch object in the system.
Continue following the dispatch mechanism for a given
controller until you reach another controller with a
_dispatch method defined.  Use the new _dispatch
method until another controller with _dispatch defined
or until the url has been traversed to entirety.

This module also contains the standard ObjectDispatch
class which provides the ordinary TurboGears mechanism.

class ObjectDispatcher(Dispatcher):
    """
    Object dispatch (also "object publishing") means that each portion of the
    URL becomes a lookup on an object.  The next part of the URL applies to the
    next object, until you run out of URL.  Processing starts on a "Root"
    object.

    Thus, /foo/bar/baz become URL portion "foo", "bar", and "baz".  The
    dispatch looks for the "foo" attribute on the Root URL, which returns
    another object.  The "bar" attribute is looked for on the new object, which
    returns another object.  The "baz" attribute is similarly looked for on
    this object.

    Dispatch does not have to be directly on attribute lookup, objects can also
    have other methods to explain how to dispatch from them.  The search ends
    when a decorated controller method is found.

    The rules work as follows:

    1) If the current object under consideration is a decorated controller
       method, the search is ended.

    2) If the current object under consideration has a "default" method, keep a
       record of that method.  If we fail in our search, and the most recent
       method recorded is a "default" method, then the search is ended with
       that method returned.

    3) If the current object under consideration has a "lookup" method, keep a
       record of that method.  If we fail in our search, and the most recent
       method recorded is a "lookup" method, then execute the "lookup" method,
       and start the search again on the return value of that method.

    4) If the URL portion exists as an attribute on the object in question,
       start searching again on that attribute.

    5) If we fail our search, try the most recent recorded methods as per 2 and
       3.
